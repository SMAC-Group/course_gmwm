- Comment on the plot of the time series: does it appear to be stationary?
- If not stationary, use a linear regression to remove possible trends and/or seasonalities.
- Perform a diagnostic analysis on the residuals: does there appear to be dependence between lags?
- If there appears to be dependence in the residuals, propose and estimate a time series model for them. Justify the model.
