- Write an R function that computes the AVAR of the input (`avar` function) and estimates $\hat \sigma^2$ (use Equation 3.10 and 3.11). 
- Chose a value for $\sigma^2$ and $N$, e.g., $1$ and $1000$, and generate $M$ realization of $X_t$.
- Compare the perfomances of the two estimators (use the `boxplot` R function).
- What is the difference?
