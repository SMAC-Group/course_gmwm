<exercise id="1" title="General Information">

In this chapter we will consider an introduction to time series analysis from standard statistical standpoint. This chapter is based on the R package [`simts`](https://smac-group.github.io/simts/index.html). This package is currently being modified and is likely to change significantly in the coming months. Therefore, we recommend to install the *development* version of the package as follows:

```r
# Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# Install simts from GitHub
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/simts")
```

The sildes we will can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/course_smac_epfl/raw/master/pdf_slides/slides_chap2.pdf).
