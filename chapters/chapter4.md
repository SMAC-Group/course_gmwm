<exercise id="1" title="General Information">

This repository holds the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) R package. This estimation technique was introduces in [Guerrier et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2013.799920) and uses the wavelet variances in a moment-matching spirit to estimate parameters of time series models such as ARMA or state-space models. This package is currently being modified and is likely to change significantly in the coming months. The *development* version of the package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/gmwm) and can be installed as follows:

```r
# Install dependencies
install.packages("devtools")

# Install/Update the package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/gmwm")
```

The main features of the package are presented in the sections below and will use data from the `imudata` R package, which can be installed as:

```r
# Install/Update the package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/imudata")
```

Note that the installation process may be a little slow.

The sildes we will can be downloaded here:  [part I](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/course_smac_epfl/raw/master/pdf_slides/slides_chap4_1.pdf), and [part II](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/course_smac_epfl/raw/master/pdf_slides/slides_chap4_2.pdf).

# Simulation

- Simulate an AR(1) with the parameters and sample size of your choice.
- Write a function that computes $\hat{Q}_n(\bm{\theta})$ as defined in the previous slide with $\bm{\Omega} = \mathbf{I}$.
- Find the GMWM estimator for the data you simulate in Step 1. Are the estimated parameters close to the correct ones?
- Compare the results with the ones obtained with the \texttt{gmwm()} function.

# Estimation

- Show that the theoretical WV for the model WN() + RW() can be expressed as $\bm{\nu}(\bm{\theta}) = \mathbf{X}\bm{\theta}$.
- In this case, show that the GMWM has a closed form solution.
- Simulate a time series with the parameter $\sigma^2 = 4$, $\gamma^2 = 0.01$ and $T = 10^4$. Compare the AVLR, GMWM (based on the \texttt{gmwm()} function) and the GMWM (closed form). Which estimator is the best one?
- Perform a simulation study to compare the three estimators. Are your results consistent with the ones of \cite{guerrier2016theoretical} (presented in the previous slide)?

# Econometic time series

- Plot the US saving rates data-set (get the data with \texttt{data(savingrt, package = "simts")})
- Find a suitable model of the type ``random walk + noise'' using the \texttt{gmwm()}. 
- Compare the robust and non-robust estimators.

 	
# Inertial sensor

- Find a suitable for error model to describe the signal of ln200 gyroscope. You can get the data as follows: \lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\tiny, language=r]{ln200.r}
- Same question for a KVH1750 accelerometer: \lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\tiny, language=r]{kvh.r}
