# Case Study: Hydrology

---


In the following example we try to find a model that characterizes the observed precipitations per month over number of years. First we load the precipitation data and plot them. 

```r
# Load hydro dataset
data(hydro, package = "simts")

# Simulate based on data
hydro = gts(as.vector(hydro), start = 1907, freq = 12)


```

---

```r
# Plot hydro
plot(hydro)
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="hydro1-1.png" alt=" " width="85%">

---

Then we estimate WV using both standard and robust approach and compare them. Noting that in this case the observed data are not necessary *outliers* in terms of observations. However, the *robust* estimation de-weights the influence of extreme precipitation events on the model.

```r
# Plot wv
wv = wvar(hydro)
wv_rob = wvar(hydro, robust = TRUE)
compare_wvar(wv, wv_rob, split = FALSE)
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="hydro2-1.png" alt=" " width="85%">

Finally we suggest a model and observe its correspondences with the empirical time series.

```r
mod = gmwm(AR1(), hydro, robust = TRUE)
plot(mod)
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="hydro3-1.png" alt=" " width="85%">

---

```{r, cache=TRUE}
summary(mod)
```
